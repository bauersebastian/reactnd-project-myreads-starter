This is a React App called MyReads.
It keeps track of book you currently read, want to read and have read.

The app was build as a project at Udacity's React Nanodegree Programme.

## How to get started

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Move to the root folder of the project.
Start the app with npm or yarn.

Commands:
npm start
or
yarn start

The app starts to run at Port 3000.

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
